                    <h2>Research</h2>
					<p>The main focus of my research is to explore how we can teach a robot how to interact while interacting in the real world. Having a robot learning in the real world and especially while interacting with humans is a challenging scenario as gathering datapoints for learning can be expensive and dangerous (ruling out big data algorithms such as Deep Learning and classical Reinforcement Learning algorithm relying on exploration to gather information).
					</p>
					<p>We believe the solution is to use Interactive Machine Learning: including a human in the loop to bootstrap the learning and make it safer. We developed <a href=" http://www.tech.plym.ac.uk/SoCCE/CRNS/staff/esenft/papers/2015-ES-ICSR.pdf">SPARC</a> (for Supervised Progressively Autonomous Robot Competencies) as a learning paradigm allowing a robot to learn while interacting in the real world and ensuring that its action policy is correct even during the early stages of the learning. SPARC relies on a suggestion/correction mechanism whereby the robot can suggest an action to a human supervisor who can either passively accept the action and let it be executed after a small delay or correct it to provide the adequate action. This allow to rely importantly on the human at the start of the interaction when the robot is still learning how to interact, and as the robot learns a more efficient action policy, the workload on the supervisor decreases.
					</p>
					<p>This approach is to be tested in the real world as part of the <a href="http://dream2020.eu/">DREAM Project</a> which seeks to develop new Robot-Enhanced Therapies for children with ASD. A therapist would start to control the robot in a Wizard of Oz-like fashion (the robot being maily tele-operated) and as the algorithm learns the therapist’s desire, the robot is making more appropriate suggestions which can be simply passively accepted reducing the workload on the therapist over time. This would allow robots to be used in therapies more easily, without requiring important involvement of technical staff to control the robot.
					</p>
					<p>SPARC has been developed with the Robot Enhanced Therapy scenario in mind, but is applicable to a wider range of uses, such as an assistant at home which would learn from its user their desires and would find way to inform them about action about to be executed without having the human to correct them a posteriori.
