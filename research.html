                    <h2>Research</h2>
					<p>The main focus of my research is to explore how robots can learn complex interactive policy in the real world. Having a robot learning in the real world and especially while interacting with humans is a challenging scenario as gathering datapoints for learning can be expensive and dangerous (ruling out big data algorithms such as Deep Learning and classical Reinforcement Learning algorithm relying on random exploration to gather information).
					</p>
					<p>I believe that the solution is to use Interactive Machine Learning: including a human in the loop to bootstrap the learning and make it safer. We developed <a href="https://emmanuel-senft.github.io/papers/2015-ES-ICSR.pdf">SPARC</a> (for Supervised Progressively Autonomous Robot Competencies), a learning paradigm to teach robots policies in real world interactions. The presence of the human in the action selection loop ensures that each action executed is correct even in the early stages of the learning. SPARC relies on a selection/suggestion/correction mechanism whereby the human can select actions for the robot, the robot can suggest an action to the human supervisor who can either passively accept the action and let it be executed after a small delay or prevent it. This allow to rely importantly on the human at the start of the interaction when the robot is still learning how to interact. Then, as the robot improves its policy, its autonomy can increase, thus reducing the workload on the supervisor.
					</p>
					<p>This approach has been developed as part of the <a href="http://dream2020.eu/">DREAM Project</a> which seeks to develop new Robot-Enhanced Therapies for children with ASD. In this context, a therapist would start to control the robot in a Wizard of Oz-like fashion (the robot being maily tele-operated) and as the algorithm learns the therapist’s desire, the robot is making more appropriate suggestions which can be simply passively accepted reducing the workload on the therapist over time. This would allow robots to be used in therapies more easily, without requiring important involvement of technical staff to control the robot. SPARC has been applied to the context of tutor robots, supporting children in a learning task. In my last study, a robot was taught by a psychology student to interact with children. Results showed that SPARC made the learning process safe and efficient, and that the resulting autonomous behaviour led to an autonomous behaviour similar to the one displayed when the robot was supervised by the teacher.
					</p>
					<p>SPARC has been developed with the Robot Enhanced Therapy scenario in mind, but is applicable to a wider range of uses, such as an assistant at home which would learn from its user their desires and would find way to inform them about action about to be executed without having the human to correct them a posteriori or in education where a teacher could design its own teaching assistant to interact as tutor with the children.
					</p>

                    <p>My PhD was funded by the EU FP7 <a href="http://dream2020.eu/">DREAM Project</a>, which aims to develop new Robot-Enhanced Therapies for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p>
                    <p>My main scientific interest is a curiosity about how intelligence works and how we can make robots more intelligent. I want to discover how robots can learn rich behaviours required to complete complex tasks in the real world. One example of such a task is interaction with humans, I want to find ways to enable robots to learn social behaviours adapted to HRI. In my current research, I explore how human teachers can support this learning by providing feedback and demonstrations, making the robot learning safer and faster. Consequently, my research lies at the intersection between Human-Robot Interaction, Interactive Machine Learning and Learning from Demonstrations.</p>
